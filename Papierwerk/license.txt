4. Redistribution.

   You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
   Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
   Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
       then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable

       Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a
       NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
       the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
       Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the
       NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
   provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
   reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
   Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
   distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
   in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

   Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
   submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
   under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional

   supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you
   may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
   reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty.

   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
   provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)
   on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
   either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties
   or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS

   the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
   shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
   indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
   arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use
   the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
   commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised
   of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

   While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
   to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
   However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
   and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
   and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
   harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
   Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
   liability.
